This looks like the 'advance search' in v5.1 as well is not able to be scoped manually in the search.
Ex.
select pull down menu on search field top right corner select 'Advance Search'.
You are redirected to the advance search page
There is no option to set scope on the search, on the top left corner you see options
If advance search is done from the dashboard, it allows you to select scope "All Sites" or "repository" 
If advance search is done from the dashboard, it allows you to select scope "Current Site" or "All Sites" or "repository" 
But does not allow you to set the scope of the search to a specific folder in repository.

where as this effort of mine will allows user to hit a specific target folder when you search in repository.
